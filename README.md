# TravelTableTop

Travel Table Top is an ecommerce MVP site that sells travel games sorted by age, min play time and different genres. The dataset is taken from Board Game Geek. The site is built using Django, Python, Postgres and AWS S3 bucket for the portfolio project 5 of Code Institute's Full Stack Development Diploma.

## User Experience - UX

### Strategy

I love playing board and Card games. I always try to pack small games when I go travelling to either play solo or with friends/family. On my research I could not find a website that would sell just travel size games. You need to search a lot to find decent examples. Hence, that inspired me to create a website that would sell games just for travel and cater to age groups and genres.

#### User Stories

All user stories can be found in the linked [Github Project](https://github.com/users/hennasingh/projects/8)

### Scope

The user stories were broken into epics and milestones. I had a high-level plan for the project, and I followed Boutique Ado walkthrough to add ecommerce aspect to it. 

Overall, the site aims to provide variety of travel games for your road, airplane, train trips. The platform allows both signed in and anonymous checkout and provides profile management and order history.

Home Page - Introduction to Travel games
Product Page - List of variety of games
Login/Register - To maintain profile and order history, you have to create an account on the site.

### Skeleton

The site designs were generated with help from Claude. I made changes to the design as I progressed in actual development of the site.

#### Database Schema

## Agile Methodology

Agile methodology was followed for building the complete site. User Stories were categorized in Epics and Milestones.

### EPICS => MILESTONES

I grouped user-stories in epics which were further grouped in Milestones. Some epics and milestones were added as I progressed with the app.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I applied MoSCoW prioritization and labels to my user stories within the issues tab.

- **must-have**: guaranteed to be delivered
- **should-have**: adds significant value, but not vital
- **could-have**: small impact, but nice to have
- **wont-have**: not a priority for current version

### Github Projects

The Kanban board was created to keep track of different user stories and their progress. Columns such as backlog, in-progress, done, and fixed bugs were added to visualize the workflow.

### User Story Issues

The structure of user-story issue consisted of user story, acceptance criteria, and tasks required to complete the issue. Wherever possible, the commit messages were connected to corresponding issues.
